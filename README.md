JSONLogic Editor
==============
Built complex json bodies automatically by JSONLogic editor utilizing Blockly and json-schema. All supported operations in JSONLogic structure are provided by Blockly blocks. 

Configure the data models that your API accepts, and the relationships between different endpoints.
Then, users can just drag and drop schema-compliant blocks to wire together and send multiple API requests at once.
